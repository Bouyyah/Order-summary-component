## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid layout
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used this project to mix flexbox and grid layout, as specefied within the challenge i used the active pseudo class to change css, the handling of the svg backgrouds was a bit tricky but i managed to do it with position absolute and z-index manipulation.
